# CNNs and Deep Learning Quiz

## Question 1

What does a convolutional layer do in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?

- A) It combines input features into a single output.
- B) It applies a set of filters to the input to detect patterns.
- C) It reduces the dimensionality of the input data.
- D) It generates a final classification score.



## Question 2

What is the main purpose of using pooling layers in CNNs?

- A) To increase the number of parameters in the network.
- B) To reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the input volume.
- C) To apply non-linear transformations to the data.
- D) To convert the input into a one-dimensional vector.



## Question 3

In the context of image classification, what is data augmentation?

- A) Increasing the size of the dataset by generating new images through transformations such as rotation, flipping, and scaling.
- B) Adding more layers to the CNN to increase its capacity.
- C) Using pre-trained models to improve accuracy.
- D) Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.



## Question 4

What is transfer learning in the context of deep learning?

- A) Training a new model from scratch on a specific dataset.
- B) Using a pre-trained model on a new but related problem.
- C) Combining multiple models to improve performance.
- D) Applying data augmentation techniques to the training data.



## Question 5

What is meant by translation invariance in CNNs?

- A) The ability of the network to apply the same weights to different parts of the input.
- B) The ability of the network to recognize an object regardless of its position in the image.
- C) The process of converting data from one format to another.
- D) The use of convolutional layers instead of fully connected layers.



## Question 6

What is weight sharing in CNNs?

- A) Using the same weights for different layers in the network.
- B) Applying the same weights across different parts of the input image.
- C) Sharing weights between different CNNs.
- D) Using pre-trained weights from another model.



## Question 7

What is the difference between translation invariance and translation equivariance in CNNs?

- A) Invariance means the output remains unchanged with translation, while equivariance means the output changes in a predictable way with translation.
- B) Equivariance means the output remains unchanged with translation, while invariance means the output changes in a predictable way with translation.
- C) Invariance and equivariance are the same concepts.
- D) Both terms refer to the ability of CNNs to handle rotations.
